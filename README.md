âš™ Execution Unit (FPGA Project)
This project implements a 64-bit Execution Unit using VHDL/Verilog based on the RV64I architecture. The Execution Unit performs arithmetic, logic, and shift operations through a modular ALU and shifter design. It was simulated on Quartrus and ModelSim to demonstrate how processor instructions are executed at the hardware level.
